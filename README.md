## Site 1
What is the URL?
  https://www.sarahsday.com/ 

How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?
  I was watching a youtuber that I’ve just subscribed to recently and she mentioned that she had a website. There was a link in the description box of her video and that was what got me to this website. 

How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?
  The design of the website has a very clean palette with a white background with black text being broken up once with a blush pink banner. It presents itself as very modern and current in the layout as it has social media links, the common banner theme, a lot of photography. The first thing that catches your eye is the wide banner slideshow that goes through different photos for each part of her brand. (blog, clothing, podcast etc)
  
Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?
   The navigation system is familiar is very familiar with a banner at the top with the brand name and site links.There is no “hamburger” icon but there are each of the following areas laid out cleanly at the top and because of that it’s easy to find what you are looking for right away. When you scroll down past the slideshow there is a small introduction and then banner of three photos that are links to her youtube channel, podcast and ebook. Underneath that in a blocked off blush pink section is what mimics the look of an instagram timeline but are links to different blog posts. Overall very easy to find things as you don’t even need to scroll down to find anything because it’s all laid out in the top bar. 
   
What parts of the site are interactive?
  Pretty much the whole thing is interactive, or at least the most interactive out of all five sites I have reviewed. The main slideshow banner has arrows on both sides if you want to skip to the next slide instead of waiting for it to transition itself. When you start to scroll down her little intro plus 3 photo panel banner kind of eases up and isn’t completely fixated but is in sync with your scrolling. In the pink banner area you see the “Latest From The Blog” title and when you scroll down a bit more the link to her blog posts glide up. The same happens at the bottom where her most recent pictures from instagram are located. Nothing interesting happens when you scroll over a link but when you click on them everything pops up in a soft manner to present the title, image and then the remaining text when you scroll down a bit more. The most interactive part is when you go to the top menu bar, if you hover over an option, the rest of them go light grey and the part you hovered over remains the same black it was before.
  
How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?
  I love the simple colour palette of the site, how it only uses one font and it’s easy to find everything. It certainly is a reflection of the youtuber and their personality and lifestyle which I find refreshing as they are not pushing out some sort of “fake image” but rather just what they truly enjoy.
  
What is one thing you would change about this site?
  The one thing that stood out to me that I would change is for there to be some sort of indication when you hover over a link to know that it is one. Although yes it is quite obvious its a link, maybe just having it pop off the background a bit to engage the user to be more inclined to interact with it would have been nice.

## Site 2
What is the URL?
https://m.lovingearth.net/

How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?
  I got to this website by clicking on a link in site 1 that sent me to a site of a company that the youtuber from site 1 collaborated with on a project.  

How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?
  When it takes me to the initial product that was promoted onsite 1, my first reaction was that the font was quite small and I couldn’t glance over it quickly. In the top menu bar, the font is a faded white on a dark grey background, and the description of the product you are currently on is in the same but written in light grey. The site I feel is a mix between modern and yet still outdated. The Colour palette I find a bit strange as there is a weird yellow colour used for some icons and the unnecessarily large “Add to Cart” button. When you go to the main home page, it does appear a bit trendier but I only think that is due to the brand’s packaging design which is displayed everywhere. But once you scroll a bit lower it has a pattern of banner, centered squares and then repeats, which looks strange. Also, whenever there is writing on top of a picture, it is done in white and for the most part is very difficult to read considering the font they chose it quite thin as well. I feel like they have heavily relied on their product’s pretty package design and not done a good job designing their website as well. 

Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?
  The navigation system is very familiar as it has the well-known hamburger icon in the top left corner which leads to a fullscreen image of all the different sections of the website you can go to. Of course though, if you can barely read what some of the products are, no matter how familiar the whole scrolling motion is, it’s still difficult to find what you are looking for. 

What parts of the site are interactive?
  When you hover over the hamburger icon it goes from a light grey and scrolls up to this yellow colour that is used in other icons on their website. If you scroll down farther, underneath pictures or pale yellow buttons to find out more about the product and when you hover over top of them they turn a darker yellow. At the very bottom of the main home page there is a list of more information plus contact information and when scrolled over they turn a bright white. The only other interactive part of this site is when you are viewing a single product, there is a menu bar at the top with the same light grey font on a dark grey background, but instead of going bright white it simply becomes underlined. 

How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?
  I don’t really like this sight because I find the fonts are too small to read at a glance, especially when they placed a white font overtop a product picture.The layout I found strange because it didn’t have a consistent rhythm of rectangles banners to squares and it felt sloppy. The only part of the website I thought looked pretty was the packaging design on some of the products they were producing. 

What is one thing you would change about this site?
  The one major thing that bugged was the font and I would totally change that to a bigger one so that it was more legible. Also making if they are going to place text on top of products that they at the very least make it black so that the user can read it against the brightly coloured background.

## Site 3

What is the URL?
  https://www.thecopa.ca/niagara-falls 
  
How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?
  I got here by searching on google for restaurants in my area and this was one of the places that popped up and I chose it because it looks delicious. 
  
How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?
  I think the design of this website is unique for a restaurant because the majority of restaurant sites I have seen before have the standard menu layout at the top and just a few things on the main page. The main background is an image of the inside of the restaurant that has a warm, orange glow to it which is a nice juxtaposition to the white text on a black background. When you scroll down, it reveals the menu, gallery, entertainment and contact information respectively. Although the menu prices which are on the left side has a picture behind it, because of the darker colours portrayed, it is not hard to read the white text. The more you scroll down the more menu items you see displayed in columns and the above and below columns are attached together with a small indication of a divider. For the second part of the menu shown, there is an image shown at full opacity; however, when you scroll down to the drinks sections there are low opacity images as the background of the text, but it is still easy to read.
  
Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?
  The navigation of this site is pretty standard, as it has a fixed banner at the top when you scroll down of its locations, offers, contact information, etc. I did find it interesting how there was no option for the menu at the top but I quickly realized that you had to select your location first to see their menu when you scrolled down. I found it easy to use as everything is already there for you once you select your location. 
  
What parts of the site are interactive?
  The black banner at the top with light grey text was interactive in the sense that when you hovered over an option it turned to a bright yellow colour. Also, when you began to scroll down, the columns were in a fixed location but the pictures were “underneath” them and reveleaved the more you scrolled down to the appropriate location. The last part that was interactive was that on the right-hand side of the page three were five circles fixed in a vertical fashion to indicate where you were when you scrolled up or down. The yellow ring became filled with white to show where you were as well as a title in white to the left of it. When you hovered over the circle, it turned white and the name of where you could go appeared. 
  
How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?
  The sight is unique looking other than any other restaurant sight I’ve seen before. The entertainment section is brightly lit which I think is done to represent that their entertainment is lively, upbeat and fun. Whereas the menu has darker undertones and I think this is to compliment the cozy yet elegant aesthetic of the main image of the interior of the restaurant when you first visit the site.  
  
What is one thing you would change about this site?
  I noticed that although the font is the same for the entire menu, for some reason a portion of the cocktail menu is done in bold. I would change it to be the same weight as the rest of the font used in the menu.

## Site 4
What is the URL?
  http://drawingwiffwaffles.com/ 

How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?
  I got to this website by searching it up on google. I wasn’t sure if it would actually exist but this is an artist on youtuber I watch once in a while so I was curious to see if she had a website. 
  
How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?
  The design of this website has a slight cartoon-like feel to it, but that’s very representative of the artist’s style so it’s fitting. The background is purple with little doodles drawn in a dark purple all over it to fill the screen. Front and center there is the artist’s logo which has a slight shadow around it to make it pop off the background for a more 3D effect. Without even needing to scroll down there are the links to her po box, giveaways, art and social links written in a white, bold, sans serif font. When you scroll down the background does not move but rather the logo and four links scroll up to reveal a light purple (slightly transparent) background with her social media links in the same font style on the right hand side. On the left is a simple drawing she has done and these links and drawings are centered to in the middle of the light purple banner. When you scroll down one more time, the transparent purple layer and information scrolls up and now without any other layer on top you see the original background again with another drawing of hers and some information about her PO box, once again, centered in the middle of the page. 
  
Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?
  The navigation is super simple because when you first open the site you see the main four links that you would need and when you scroll down you see the next two areas dedicated to simply two of those four links, which when clicked on will simply jump to where it is on the page instead of you needing to scroll through yourself. When you reach the bottom there is a “back to top” option which is also helpful.
  
What parts of the site are interactive?
  When you hover over any of the links, a white box immediately appears around it and the font becomes the same colour purple as the background. At the bottom where there is the “back to top” option and her contact information, since those are already in a white box and written in purple, they simple become underlined in the same purple colour to indicate that you can click on them. 
  
How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?
  I like this site because of its simplicity and of how it stayed original to the artist’s personal style. It may not seem like a particularly engaging website for someone that has never seen her youtube channel, but for just viewing the basics, I thought it was laid out in a easy fashion for anyone and very user friendly. 
  
What is one thing you would change about this site?
  The one thing that I would change about this site is when you go to the artist’s PO Box information, the address looks a little bit blurry. I would make the font a big bigger for better legibility.

## Site 5

What is the URL?
  http://drawingwiffwaffles.com/magnagirl/ 

How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?
  I got her by clicking on the “Magna Girl” link which is from Site 4’s main home page. 
  
How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?
  The design of the website is similar to Site 4’s in that it has the same font for the main links in the top menu bar and a lot of purple is used. The background is a very pale lilac, has a light purple menu header at the top with navigation options written in purple as well. Centered in the middle of the page underneath the title of the comic book, is a segment from the book as well as a description beside it in a purple textbox. Without barely having to scroll down, in a purple box there are the two comic book options to read and below that a “back to top” button which is done in a similar fashion in site 4. 
  
Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?
  The navigation system is super simple as it really only has the main menu bar at the top with all of the option that are available. 
What parts of the site are interactive?
When you scroll over the options in the top menu bar a light purple box appears around it to indicate the user can click on it. Also, when reading a comic, you can either use the arrows keys on your keyboard, or if you move your mouse to the left or right side of the screen, a white circle will appear with a cutout of a triangle in it. Other than that, there’s nothing else interactive which is kind of a let down because you would think with her being an artist she would have put more thought into how the website was laid out to better suit her personal art style. 

How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?
  I found this site to be very similar to other manga sites I have seen before, so it wasn’t anything new or exciting to me. Also I found that the overuse of purple didn’t look that great but kinda redundant especially since the main character’s clothes in the manga were made up of purple too. Overall, a little plain and not very eye catching to engage the user in wanting to find out more or even read the comic itself.
  
What is one thing you would change about this site?
  Even though the colour purple is not my favourite choice, the one thing I would change is the font in first text bubble on the right hand side underneath the menu bar. Inside of it is a brief description about the comic but my issue is that the first half of the sentence is bolded and the other half isn’t which looks strange. Either only have the first word bolded or the first section that states the main character’s names bolded, otherwise it looks strange.
